name: incident-response
description: Run an incident response workflow — triage, communicate, and write postmortem. Trigger with "we have an incident", "production is down", an alert that needs severity assessment, a status update mid-incident, or when writing a blameless postmortem after resolution.
argument-hint: "<incident description or alert>"

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Manage an incident from detection through postmortem.

## Usage

```
/incident-response $ARGUMENTS
```

## Modes

```
/incident-response new [description]     # Start a new incident
/incident-response update [status]       # Post a status update
/incident-response postmortem            # Generate postmortem from incident data
```

If no mode is specified, ask what phase the incident is in.

## Severity Classification

| Level | Criteria | Response Time |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| SEV1 | Service down, all users affected | Immediate, all-hands |
| SEV2 | Major feature degraded, many users affected | Within 15 min |
| SEV3 | Minor feature issue, some users affected | Within 1 hour |
| SEV4 | Cosmetic or low-impact issue | Next business day |

## Communication Guidance

Provide clear, factual updates at regular cadence. Include: what's happening, who's affected, what we're doing, when the next update is.

## If Connectors Available

If **~~monitoring** is connected:
- Pull alert details and metrics
- Show graphs of affected metrics

If **Plane** is connected (incidents live in the INC projects):
**Plane routing.** There are two Plane workspaces, each with its own connector. Pick by repository, then by project:

| Repository | Workspace (tools) | Project |
|---|---|---|
| liqu-fi exchange code: monorepo, synthetix-v3, synthetix-deployments, terminal, liqu-web | LIQ (`Plane_LIQ`) | MR — engineering backlog |
| Product bugs in terminal / liqu-web | LIQ | TRM — bugs, Intake only; root cause goes to MR or OPS |
| Live-system work for the exchange | LIQ | OPS |
| Dev tooling shared by both teams (plane-hooks, dev-agent, stack, CI runner) | LIQ | DX — also for yeva tooling |
| Claude Code / plan-loop harness | LIQ | HRN |
| liqu-fi/legwork | LIQ | LW |
| yevaops/ops-platform | YEVA (`Plane_YEVA`) | OPP |
| yevaops/framework | YEVA | FW |
| Live-system work for ops-platform | YEVA | OPS |
| yulii/gcs | YEVA | GCS — stages and customer only; engineering tickets live in the repo (docs/wayfinder/) |

Never read or write the YEVA project SLU (military): it is not engineering work. If the repository is unclear, ask which workspace.
Work item references look like `MR-244` or `OPP-12`: open them with `workitem retrieve_by_identifier` on the matching workspace. List a project's states with `state list` before moving anything — do not assume names.
**Writes need confirmation:** show the draft (project, title, description, state, relations) and create or change it in Plane only after the user says yes. Write titles and comments in Russian, like the existing items.

- Exchange incidents: LIQ project INC. plane-hooks opens them automatically from Grafana alerts and failed deploys (labels `alert` and `deploy-failed`), so look for an existing one before drafting a new item
- ops-platform incidents: YEVA project INC, opened by hand
- Move the incident through New → In Progress → Mitigated → Done (or Cancelled) as the response goes, and add status updates as comments
- Postmortem action items become work items in OPS (operational root cause) or MR / OPP (code root cause), each with a `relates to` relation to the incident
- Plane does not page anyone: tell the user who to contact rather than claiming on-call was paged

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Post status updates to incident channel
- Create war room channel

## Tips

1. **Start writing immediately** — Don't wait for complete information. Update as you learn more.
2. **Keep updates factual** — What we know, what we've done, what's next. No speculation.
3. **Postmortems are blameless** — Focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
